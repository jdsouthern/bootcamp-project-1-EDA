# Analysis of the Most Common Crimes in Charlotte (2017 -2023)
## Levar McKnight

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department categorizes criminal offenses into 72 categories, including a category for "Other Unlisted Non-Criminal" incidents.  Though this non-criminal category ranked as the first or second highest category throughout most of the years covered in the dataset, CMPD advised that it should not be included in the analysis of criminal incidents.
The categories of crimes were listed under the column named "Highest NIBRS Description", named after the National Incident-Based Reporting System.  

The slide labeled “Most Common Criminal Offenses by Year” illustrates the number of offenses reported in Charlotte in the past several years.  CMPD categorizes theses offenses into 72 types.  Many of these types have had double-digit, or even single-digit figures over the years.  To simplify the graph only the top ten criminal offenses that had more than 2,000 incidents in any given year were chosen to be displayed.  One category labeled “Other Unlisted Non-Criminal” was omitted from the top ten because CMPD suggested that an analysis of criminal incident reports should not include non-criminal incidents.

The crime that occurred the most annually was Theft from Motor Vehicle followed closely by “All Other Offenses”.  Theft from Motor Vehicle peaked in 2019 as did Shoplifting.  One interesting observation is that motor vehicle theft represented by the brown line was relatively stable throughout most of the years, but then shot up in 2022 and 2023.  According to CMPD, the spike is caused by a social media trend called the “Kia Challenge” that started in the summer of 2022.  In 2023, Kia and Hyundai thefts rose by 1,747%.  Overall, most offenses depicted had a significant drop in 2020, with Theft from Motor Vehicle having the steepest drop.  This shows that the COVID mandates had a significant impact on crime in the Charlotte area.
