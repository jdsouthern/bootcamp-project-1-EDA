Project 1- Kyndall's Analysis
In our project we decided to search for a dataset relating to crime. We were able to locate the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department's incident reports from 2015 to present day. We then came up with a list of questions for our hypothesis from looking over that data. 
When glancing over the data we got a pretty good indication that Covid affected many different types of incidents in Charlotte and hereafter. We were able to effectivly clean up unusable data in order to make our dataset into something we could loop through to figure out the questions to our dataset.

Finding the total incidents in Charlotte from 2017 to present day
In order to be able to build an adequate line chart to represent all of Charlotte I first had to create a dictionary to account for all the misspelled versions of Charlotte. There was 62 total initially from Matthews to Huntersville that I decided to categorize into 'OTHER'. For all misrepresentations of Charlotte I switched over to 'Charlotte".
I then incorporated the new dictionary, built the new date format to be able to read through the dataset. Then I looped all incidents from 2017 to end of 2022. I built a line chart to account for the rise and fall of crimes in Charlotte and took out all of the 'OTHER' cities attached to it to get the most accurate.
